  # Terraform Configuration

  # State configuration

  # Stacks operates Terraform states based on workspaces **IT IS VERY IMPORTANT** that you ensure a unique name for each application definition
  # Furthermore **IT IS VERY IMPORTANT** that you change the name of a workspace for each deployment stage
  # there are some best practices around this if you are going for feature based environments
  # avoid running anything past dev that is not on master
